# React Styled

## Things to Investigate

- [ ] Inline Styles
  - [ ] Radium or similar
- [ ] CSS Modules
  - [ ] Testing with CSS modules.
- [ ] SASS
- [ ] UI Testing without classes.

## App Roadmap

- [ ] Decide simple use case
  - [ ] Photo viewer?
- [ ] Get infrastructure going
- [ ] Tests?
  - I think this will be a goo idea. - UI tests are an important consideration.
- [ ] Server?
- [x] Eject?
  - I found a simple react-starter repo in github and have forked it. Will use that as the beginning. (will need to be pared down a bit to keep things clean and easy, but it is much closer.)
